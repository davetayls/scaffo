<h2>CSS Conventions</h2>
<p>Much of the CSS Guidelines are taken from the following guidelines:
</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/csswizardry/CSS-Guidelines">https://github.com/csswizardry/CSS-Guidelines</a>

</p>
<p>Much respect to <a href="http://csswizardry.com/">Harry Roberts</a>, he gives a good basis for good CSS style although
it is important to read them understanding that there are areas which apply
specifically to his context.

</p>
<h2>Naming conventions</h2>
<p>For the most part I simply use hyphen delimited classes (e.g. <code>.foo-bar</code>, not
<code>.foo_bar</code> or <code>.fooBar</code>), however in certain circumstances I use BEM (Block,
Element, Modifier) notation.

</p>
<p><abbr title="Block, Element, Modifier">BEM</abbr> is a methodology for naming
and classifying CSS selectors in a way to make them a lot more strict,
transparent and informative.

</p>
<p>The naming convention follows this pattern:

</p>
<pre><code>.block{}
.block__element{}
.block--modifier{}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>.block</code> represents the higher level of an abstraction or component.</li>
<li><code>.block__element</code> represents a descendent of <code>.block</code> that helps form <code>.block</code>
as a whole.</li>
<li><code>.block--modifier</code> represents a different state or version of <code>.block</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An <strong>analogy</strong> of how BEM classes work might be:

</p>
<pre><code>.person{}
.person--woman{}
    .person__hand{}
    .person__hand--left{}
    .person__hand--right{}</code></pre>
<p>Here we can see that the basic object we’re describing is a person, and that a
different type of person might be a woman. We can also see that people have
hands; these are sub-parts of people, and there are different variations,
like left and right.

</p>
<p>We can now namespace our selectors based on their base objects and we can also
communicate what job the selector does; is it a sub-component (<code>__</code>) or a
variation (<code>--</code>)?

</p>
<p>So, <code>.page-wrapper</code> is a standalone selector; it doesn’t form part of an
abstraction or a component and as such it named correctly. <code>.widget-heading</code>,
however, <em>is</em> related to a component; it is a child of the <code>.widget</code> construct
so we would rename this class <code>.widget__heading</code>.

</p>
<p>BEM looks a little uglier, and is a lot more verbose, but it grants us a lot of
power in that we can glean the functions and relationships of elements from
their classes alone. Also, BEM syntax will typically compress (gzip) very well
as compression favours/works well with repetition.

</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you need to use BEM or not, always ensure classes are
sensibly named; keep them as short as possible but as long as necessary. Ensure
any objects or abstractions are very vaguely named (e.g. <code>.ui-list</code>, <code>.media</code>)
to allow for greater reuse. Extensions of objects should be much more explicitly
named (e.g. <code>.user-avatar-link</code>). Don’t worry about the amount or length of
classes; gzip will compress well written code <em>incredibly</em> well.
