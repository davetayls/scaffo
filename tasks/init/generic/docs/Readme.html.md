CSS Conventions
---------------

Much of the CSS Guidelines are taken from the following guidelines:
<https://github.com/csswizardry/CSS-Guidelines>

Much respect to [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/), he gives a good basis for good CSS style although
it is important to read them understanding that there are areas which apply
specifically to his context.

## Naming conventions

For the most part I simply use hyphen delimited classes (e.g. `.foo-bar`, not
`.foo_bar` or `.fooBar`), however in certain circumstances I use BEM (Block,
Element, Modifier) notation.

<abbr title="Block, Element, Modifier">BEM</abbr> is a methodology for naming
and classifying CSS selectors in a way to make them a lot more strict,
transparent and informative.

The naming convention follows this pattern:

    .block{}
    .block__element{}
    .block--modifier{}

* `.block` represents the higher level of an abstraction or component.
* `.block__element` represents a descendent of `.block` that helps form `.block`
  as a whole.
* `.block--modifier` represents a different state or version of `.block`.

An **analogy** of how BEM classes work might be:

    .person{}
    .person--woman{}
        .person__hand{}
        .person__hand--left{}
        .person__hand--right{}

Here we can see that the basic object we’re describing is a person, and that a
different type of person might be a woman. We can also see that people have
hands; these are sub-parts of people, and there are different variations,
like left and right.

We can now namespace our selectors based on their base objects and we can also
communicate what job the selector does; is it a sub-component (`__`) or a
variation (`--`)?

So, `.page-wrapper` is a standalone selector; it doesn’t form part of an
abstraction or a component and as such it named correctly. `.widget-heading`,
however, _is_ related to a component; it is a child of the `.widget` construct
so we would rename this class `.widget__heading`.

BEM looks a little uglier, and is a lot more verbose, but it grants us a lot of
power in that we can glean the functions and relationships of elements from
their classes alone. Also, BEM syntax will typically compress (gzip) very well
as compression favours/works well with repetition.

Regardless of whether you need to use BEM or not, always ensure classes are
sensibly named; keep them as short as possible but as long as necessary. Ensure
any objects or abstractions are very vaguely named (e.g. `.ui-list`, `.media`)
to allow for greater reuse. Extensions of objects should be much more explicitly
named (e.g. `.user-avatar-link`). Don’t worry about the amount or length of
classes; gzip will compress well written code _incredibly_ well.
